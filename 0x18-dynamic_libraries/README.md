#DYNAMIC LIBRABRIES

A dynamic library, also known as a shared library, is a type of library in computer programming that contains code and data that can be used by multiple programs simultaneously. Unlike static libraries, which are linked at compile-time and become part of the executable file, dynamic libraries are loaded into memory at runtime, allowing multiple programs to share the same code and resources.
